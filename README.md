# 72-Bit-Extended-Hamming-Decoder-for-64-bit-data
This repository hosts the Vivado IP core for an Extended Hamming Code Decoder designed to correct and manage 64-bit data encapsulated in a 72-bit codeword. Ideal for FPGA implementations, this IP core ensures robust error correction and detection, tailored for high-reliability communication systems and data storage applications.
